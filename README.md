# Social Media Engagement Analysis
This project is a single-page website containing an interactive data dashboard. 
## Technologies/Libraries
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) was used to manage the layout of the site.
5. [D3](https://d3js.org/) was used to build the charts. DC.js and Crossfilter.js were not used as it was easier to find examples for the chart types needed (Violin plot, bump chart, Correlation plot+line) in D3.js.
